## Overview

I reflect on my professional journey over three years since completing my master's degree, detailing personal and career growth experiences.

## First Year Highlights

- Left first full-time job due to uncertainty around Covid-19 response
- Chose a small company (4 employees) over a larger company with 1,000+ employees
- Felt uncertain about professional direction
- Worked with senior engineers who provided learning opportunities

## Second Year Reflections

- Continued feeling directionless
- Made "locally optimal answers" without clear career goals
- Received lower-than-expected performance evaluation

## Third Year Developments

Key insights and professional growth:
- Understood company's role in capitalist economy
- Developed sense of professional responsibility
- Began exploring product and project management
- Read relevant professional development books:
  - PMBOK
  - "Inspired"
  - User experience and design texts
- Practiced Scrum
- Distinguished between Scrum and Kanban methodologies

## Future Objectives

Proposed goals for fourth year:
- Learn three new programming languages
- Create a hobby service project
- Read ten computer science books
- Write ten articles about book learnings
- Successfully manage three projects

Evaluation method: 0 to 0.7 scoring scale

## Conclusion

I acknowledge ongoing professional development and emerging clarity about long-term career aspirations.
