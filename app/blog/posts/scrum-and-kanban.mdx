## Introduction

I explore solving development and operational process challenges by examining Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum and Kanban.

## Development Process: Scrum Characteristics

Key Scrum principles include:

- Initial project planning with high-level overview
- Gathering user stories
- Making rough estimates
- Dividing project into 1-4 week iterations
- Measuring team development velocity
- Completing deployable user stories per iteration
- Adjusting scope or timeline as needed

## Operational Process: Kanban Characteristics

Kanban focuses on:

- Task cycle time optimization
- Work-in-progress limits
- Task status visualization
- Continuous workflow management

## Key Insights

I note that Scrum works best for project-based work with clear deadlines, while Kanban suits continuous operational tasks. The challenge is integrating both approaches effectively.

## Conclusion

By discussing and implementing Kanban and Scrum principles, the team:
- Improved process efficiency
- Reduced cycle times
- Maintained project delivery commitments

I remain interested in further exploring DevOps and SRE practices to enhance team performance.
