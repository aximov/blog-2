## The Challenge

I faced a problem balancing development projects and operational tasks while maintaining promises to stakeholders. Initially exploring DevOps and SRE, I found implementation challenging in a single team environment.

## Scrum Methodology Insights

Key Scrum characteristics include:

- Initial project planning with broad success criteria
- Gathering user stories
- Making rough estimates
- Dividing project into 1-4 week iterations
- Measuring team development velocity
- Completing deployable user stories each iteration
- Adjusting scope or timeline as needed

## Kanban Methodology Insights

Kanban focuses on:

- Task cycle time optimization
- Work-in-progress limits
- Task status visualization
- Continuous workflow management

## Key Observations

I discovered that:
- Scrum works well for project-based work
- Kanban suits continuous operational tasks
- Combining both requires careful process design
- Team culture and process understanding matter more than strict methodology adherence

The article concludes by noting my ongoing exploration of DevOps and SRE practices, seeking to improve team efficiency and process management.
